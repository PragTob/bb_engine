### Basic Actions/Events
* Blocks
* Fouls
* Free Throws
* Foul Out
* Loose Balls
* Inbound

### Basic Game Engine Features
* use real player skills (find a data source etc)
* adjust values to make sense (does it make sense to build _autotune_ ?)

### Advanced Events
* Dunks/Layups/CloseQuarterShots
* Alley-Oop
* 3 second violations
* Goaltending
* Jump Balls (turning over possession according to FIBA rules)

### Advanced Game Engine Features
* offensive focus
* degree of openness to determine if a shot is taken/difficulty of a pass etc.
* Bonus to score attempts from passes/rebounds
* fatigue (that also regenerates to some extent but never over a maximum during timeouts, breaks etc)
* a degree of "hotness" for individual players or the whole time, when players come in they're cold, when everything is going well they're getting "hotter". Used to penalize frequent subs or give the opportunity to call a time out to "cool down" the other team
* dynamic tactic changes (if minute over bla and bla do substitute player)
* points per quarter per team breakdown (possibly all stats)

## Balance

* we're making too many points
* Too many "Forced Shot" events are happening

## Internal
* switch random module to not always take the game_state but maybe just the seed
  * this'd result in having to reset the seed manually a lot of times again

## Design

### Situations
Introduce the concept of "situations" that can then play out with different actions and produce different events.

Ideas for situations:

* Three Point Line - possible actions: pass, drive, shoot, hold ball, initiate pick and roll?
* Midrange
* Close
* Fast Break
* Pick Game (Pick & Roll, Pick & Pop etc)

Situations would also have a degree of openness etc.

Q: How to represent great passes/cuts that result in an immediate basket
