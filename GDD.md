The game should...

* be a relatively realistic simulation of the game of Basketball
* have a manageable youth team where you can invest money and make your stars of tomorrow grow
* games can be coached "live" with a direct effect on the match outcome, proceedings of the match
  * hence we need a mechanism to shift game times around if both players agree so that both players can make it ideally
  * extensive automated rules for substitutions/tactics changes based on conditions to make up for not being able to be live there
* be worthwhile for a casual and a more hardcore audience
  * There should be something that you can do/check every day, but you don't have to
* not offer "definitive advantages" for paying players, they won't get money, their players won't be better they'll get convenience features, statistics, maybe a better search etc. - no match should be "oh one is a paying player that player will win"
* "unconventional" should be developable and worthwhile, a highly skilled but too small player should still be able to be a good whatever, a bigman who can shoot 3s very well should have their place etc
  * probably through a "potential" system that sort of shows which way a player can grow together with talent a 1.95m player might become the best PF in the game
* extensive meaningful tactical options to toy with and outwit your opponent even if they run a better team
* extensive statistics to devour and analyze
